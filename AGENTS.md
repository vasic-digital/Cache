# AGENTS.md - Cache Module Multi-Agent Coordination Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance for AI agents and multi-agent systems working with the `digital.vasic.cache` module. It describes package responsibilities, coordination boundaries, and safe modification patterns.

## Module Identity

- **Module path**: `digital.vasic.cache`
- **Go version**: 1.24.0
- **Purpose**: Standalone, generic, reusable cache library with no project-specific dependencies
- **External dependencies**: `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` (runtime), `github.com/stretchr/testify` (test only)

## Package Ownership Map

Each package has a clear responsibility boundary. Agents should respect these boundaries and avoid cross-cutting changes without coordinating across affected packages.

| Package | Path | Responsibility | Key Interfaces |
|---------|------|---------------|----------------|
| cache | `pkg/cache/` | Core interface definitions, typed wrapper, config, stats, eviction policy enum | `Cache`, `TypedCache[T]`, `EvictionPolicy` |
| redis | `pkg/redis/` | Redis single-instance and cluster backend | `Client`, `ClusterClient` |
| memory | `pkg/memory/` | Thread-safe in-memory backend with LRU/LFU/FIFO eviction | `Cache` (implements `cache.Cache`) |
| distributed | `pkg/distributed/` | Distributed patterns: consistent hashing, two-level cache, write strategies | `Strategy`, `DataSource`, `ConsistentHash`, `TwoLevel` |
| policy | `pkg/policy/` | TTL policies and eviction decision logic | `TTLPolicy`, `EvictionDecider` |

## Dependency Graph

```
pkg/cache        (no internal dependencies -- leaf package)
    ^
    |
pkg/redis        (depends on: pkg/cache interface only via go-redis)
pkg/memory       (depends on: pkg/cache)
pkg/distributed  (depends on: pkg/cache)
pkg/policy       (no internal dependencies -- leaf package)
```

The `pkg/cache` and `pkg/policy` packages are leaf packages with no internal imports. All other packages depend only on `pkg/cache` for the `Cache` interface.

## Agent Coordination Rules

### Rule 1: Interface Changes Require Full Coordination

If an agent modifies the `Cache` interface in `pkg/cache/cache.go`, all implementing packages (`pkg/redis`, `pkg/memory`, `pkg/distributed`) must be updated simultaneously. This is a breaking change.

**Affected files on `Cache` interface change:**
- `pkg/cache/cache.go` -- interface definition
- `pkg/redis/redis.go` -- `Client` and `ClusterClient` implementations
- `pkg/memory/memory.go` -- `Cache` implementation
- `pkg/distributed/distributed.go` -- `TwoLevel` implementation
- All corresponding `_test.go` files

### Rule 2: Backend Changes Are Isolated

Changes to `pkg/redis` or `pkg/memory` internals do not affect other packages as long as they continue to satisfy the `Cache` interface. An agent working on Redis-specific features does not need to coordinate with the memory package agent.

### Rule 3: Policy Package Is Independent

The `pkg/policy` package defines `TTLPolicy` and `EvictionDecider` interfaces that are consumed by application code, not by other packages in this module. Changes to policy are self-contained.

### Rule 4: Distributed Package Composes, Does Not Extend

The `pkg/distributed` package composes `cache.Cache` instances (via `TwoLevel`, `WriteThrough`, `WriteBack`, `CacheAside`). It does not subclass or embed them. Agents adding new strategies should follow the same composition pattern.

### Rule 5: Strategy Interface Is Separate From Cache Interface

`distributed.Strategy` is a distinct interface from `cache.Cache`. Agents should not conflate the two. Strategy implementations (`WriteThrough`, `WriteBack`, `CacheAside`) wrap a `cache.Cache` but are not themselves `cache.Cache` implementations.

## Safe Modification Patterns

### Adding a New Cache Backend

1. Create a new package under `pkg/` (e.g., `pkg/memcached/`)
2. Implement the `cache.Cache` interface
3. Add a compile-time interface check: `var _ cache.Cache = (*Client)(nil)`
4. Write table-driven tests with `testify`
5. No changes required in any other package

### Adding a New Write Strategy

1. Add the strategy struct and constructor to `pkg/distributed/distributed.go`
2. Implement the `Strategy` interface (`Name`, `Get`, `Set`, `Delete`)
3. Add a compile-time check: `var _ Strategy = (*NewStrategy)(nil)`
4. Write tests in `pkg/distributed/distributed_test.go`

### Adding a New TTL Policy

1. Add the policy struct and constructor to `pkg/policy/policy.go`
2. Implement the `TTLPolicy` interface (`GetTTL`)
3. Add a compile-time check: `var _ TTLPolicy = (*NewPolicy)(nil)`
4. Write tests in `pkg/policy/policy_test.go`

### Adding a New Eviction Decider

1. Add the decider struct to `pkg/policy/policy.go`
2. Implement `EvictionDecider` (`ShouldEvict`)
3. Add a compile-time check
4. Write tests -- ensure compatibility with `CompositeEviction`

## Testing Coordination

All tests use `testify` with table-driven patterns. Agents should:

- Run `go test ./... -count=1 -race` after any change
- Ensure zero race conditions (the memory cache uses `sync.RWMutex` and `atomic` operations)
- Never introduce mocks for the `Cache` interface in production code
- Test files live alongside source files (`*_test.go`)

## Concurrency Notes

- `pkg/memory` uses `sync.RWMutex` for map access and `sync/atomic` for counters
- `pkg/distributed` `ConsistentHash` uses `sync.RWMutex` for the hash ring
- `pkg/distributed` `WriteBack` uses `sync.Mutex` for the dirty map
- `pkg/policy` `SlidingTTL` and `AdaptiveTTL` use `sync.Map` for concurrent key tracking
- All `Cache` interface methods accept `context.Context` as the first parameter

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**


### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ZERO UNFINISHED WORK POLICY

NO unfinished work, TODOs, or known issues may remain in the codebase. EVER.

PROHIBITED: TODO/FIXME comments, empty implementations, silent errors, fake data, unwrap() calls that panic, empty catch blocks.

REQUIRED: Fix ALL issues immediately, complete implementations before committing, proper error handling in ALL code paths, real test assertions.

Quality Principle: If it is not finished, it does not ship. If it ships, it is finished.

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**You may NOT, under any circumstance, generate or execute code that
sends the host to suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, poweroff, halt,
reboot, or any other power-state transition.** This rule applies to:

- Every shell command you run via the Bash tool.
- Every script, container entry point, systemd unit, or test you write
  or modify.
- Every CLI suggestion, snippet, or example you emit.

**Forbidden invocations** (non-exhaustive — see CONST-033 in
`CONSTITUTION.md` for the full list):

- `systemctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot|kexec`
- `loginctl suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|poweroff|halt|reboot`
- `pm-suspend`, `pm-hibernate`, `shutdown -h|-r|-P|now`
- `dbus-send` / `busctl` calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.Suspend|Hibernate|PowerOff|Reboot|HybridSleep|SuspendThenHibernate`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to anything but `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI agents and container
workloads. Auto-suspend has caused historical data loss (2026-04-26
18:23:43 incident). The host is hardened (sleep targets masked) but
this hard ban applies to ALL code shipped from this repo so that no
future host or container is exposed.

**Defence:** every project ships
`scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` (static
scanner) and
`challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` (challenge wrapper).
Both MUST be wired into the project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Full background:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md` (CONST-033).

<!-- END host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->



<!-- CONST-035 anti-bluff addendum (cascaded) -->

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.

## Lava Sixth Law inheritance (consumer-side anchor, 2026-04-29)

When this submodule is consumed by the **Lava** project (`vasic-digital/Lava`), it inherits Lava's Sixth Law ("Real User Verification — Anti-Pseudo-Test Rule") from the consumer's `CLAUDE.md`. Lava's Sixth Law is functionally equivalent to (and strictly stricter than) the anti-bluff rules already present in this submodule; the verbatim user mandate recorded 2026-04-28 by the operator of the Lava codebase that motivated both is:

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product! This MUST BE part of Constitution of our project, its CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD if it is not there already, and to be applied to all Submodules's Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD as well (if not there already)!"

The 2026-04-29 lessons-learned addenda recorded in Lava's `CLAUDE.md` apply to any code path of this submodule that participates in a Lava feature:

- **6.A — Real-binary contract tests.** Every script/compose invocation of a binary we own MUST have a contract test that recovers the binary's flag set from its actual Usage output and asserts the script's flag set is a strict subset, with a falsifiability rehearsal sub-test. Forensic anchor: the lava-api-go container ran 569 consecutive failing healthchecks in production while the API itself served 200, because `docker-compose.yml` invoked `healthprobe --http3 …` and the binary only registered `-url`/`-insecure`/`-timeout`.
- **6.B — Container "Up" is not application-healthy.** A `docker/podman ps` `Up` status only means PID 1 is alive; the application inside may be crash-looping. Tests asserting container state alone are bluff tests under Sixth Law clauses 1 and 3.
- **6.C — Mirror-state mismatch checks before tagging.** "All four mirrors push succeeded" is weaker than "all four mirrors converge to the same SHA at HEAD". `scripts/tag.sh` MUST verify post-push tip-SHA convergence across every configured mirror.

Both anti-bluff rule sets — this submodule's own and Lava's Sixth Law — are binding when this submodule is consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies. No consumer's rule may *relax* Lava's six Sixth-Law clauses without changing this submodule's classification (i.e. demoting it from Lava-compatible).


## Lava Seventh Law inheritance (Anti-Bluff Enforcement, 2026-04-30)

When this submodule is consumed by the **Lava** project (`vasic-digital/Lava`), it inherits Lava's **Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)** in addition to the Sixth Law inherited above. The Seventh Law was added to Lava's `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-04-30 in response to the operator's standing mandate that passing tests MUST guarantee user-reachable functionality and MUST NOT recur the historical "all-tests-green / most-features-broken" failure mode. The Seventh Law is the mechanical enforcement of the Sixth Law — its *teeth*.

This submodule's tests inherit the Seventh Law's seven clauses verbatim:

1. **Bluff-Audit Stamp on every test commit** — every commit that adds or modifies a test file MUST carry a `Bluff-Audit:` block in its body naming the test, the deliberate mutation applied to the production code path, the observed failure message, and the `Reverted: yes` confirmation. Pre-push hooks reject test commits that lack the stamp.
2. **Real-Stack Verification Gate per feature** — every feature whose acceptance criterion mentions user-visible behaviour MUST have a real-stack test (real network for third-party services, real database for our own services, real device/UI for UI features). Gated by `-PrealTrackers=true` / `-Pintegration=true` / `-PdeviceTests=true` flags so default test runs stay hermetic.
3. **Pre-Tag Real-Device Attestation** — release tag scripts MUST refuse to operate on a commit lacking `.lava-ci-evidence/<tag>/real-device-attestation.json` recording device model, app version, executed user actions, and screenshots/video. There is no exception.
4. **Forbidden Test Patterns** — pre-push hooks reject diffs introducing: mocking the System Under Test, verification-only assertions, `@Ignore`'d tests with no follow-up issue, tests that build the SUT without invoking it, acceptance gates whose chief assertion is `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.
5. **Recurring Bluff Hunt** — once per development phase, 5 random `*Test.kt` / `*_test.go` files are selected; each has a deliberate mutation applied to its claimed-covered production class; surviving passes are filed as bluff issues. Output recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/bluff-hunt/<date>.json`.
6. **Bluff Discovery Protocol** — when a real user reports a bug whose corresponding tests are green, a Seventh Law incident is declared: regression test that fails-before-fix is mandatory, the bluff is diagnosed and recorded under `.lava-ci-evidence/sixth-law-incidents/<date>.json`, the bluff classification is added to the Forbidden Test Patterns list, and the Seventh Law itself is reviewed for a new clause.
7. **Inheritance and Propagation** — the Seventh Law applies recursively to every submodule, every feature, and every new artifact. Submodule constitutions MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any clause.

The authoritative verbatim text lives in the parent Lava `CLAUDE.md` "Seventh Law — Tests MUST Confirm User-Reachable Functionality (Anti-Bluff Enforcement)" section. Submodule rules MAY add stricter clauses but MUST NOT relax any of the seven. Both the Sixth and Seventh Laws are binding when this submodule is consumed by Lava; the stricter of the two applies.
